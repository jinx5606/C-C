            <h2 class="underline">Covid Statment</h2>
            <p>We would like to take this opportunity to wish everyone well and hope you are all weathering this challenging storm we are going through. Many of our clients have had to change or cancel wedding plans which we understand is very devastating for some and we hope they will be able to have their dream day soon.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During this time of such uncertainty and changes to our way of life, we would like to let everyone know we are going the extra mile to ensure complete safety for any and all services we provide. Having been in business for 20 years, we strive for excellence in all we do and this is no exception.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We have purchased some new equipment to ensure safe service for both our clients and staff. All staff are provided with PPE for every job and practice social distancing. We provide hand sanitizer for everyone's use and all of our services are no contact.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our ice cream bar has been changed from a self serve toppings bar to having our staff serve up your toppings as you choose. We have new equipment to allow for safe serving. However, if you are still not comfortable with this, we can 'prescoop' sundaes with lids and hand them out. We have done this at various facilities, including Windsor Regional Hospital and Catalent Pharma Solutions and have been very well received.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We wish you all the very best and have a safe journey through this troubled time.</p>

            <h2 class="underline">Specialty Coffee Bar</h2>
            <p>We offer a well appointed portable bar where we serve a variety of specialty coffees, hot and cold, fresh brewed. These include espresso, cappuccino, latte, and steamer. They come in a variety of flavours that are sure to appeal to everyone. We also offer a variety of teas for the "non-coffee" drinker.</p>
            <br>
            <p>ESPRESSO - is Italian in origin meaning "a cup of coffee brewed expressly for you". It is 3 ounces of pressured brewed coffee with a rich golden "cream" on the surface which is a sign of a premium quality brew....for the true coffee drinker.</p>
            <br>
            <p>CAPPUCCINO - is an Italian coffee drink prepared with espresso and steamed, foamed milk. These traditionally have a flavoured syrup of your choice added.</p>
            <br>
            <p>LATTE - is basically the same as a cappuccino, just less coffee and more milk.</p>
            <br>
            <p>STEAMER - is a beverage that consists of a soothing and creamy combination of steamed milk and a shot of flavoured syrup. The result is a hot flavoured caffeine free alternative beverage.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our coffee bar is unlimited drinks and comes with up to 2 professional attendants. We supply everything…cups, milk, sugar, etc.</p>
